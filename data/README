savant_data.csv:  2016 regular season pitch-by-pitch data (through July)
                  downloaded from BaseballSavant.com (thanks!). In my
                  experience you need to download these data in 5-day batches,
                  or else the size of the data file is too large to be
                  prepared correctly.
